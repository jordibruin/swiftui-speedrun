# SwiftUI Speedrun entry
My approach for the speedrun event

My focus was on making sure all elements were covered (such as the little rectangles in the corners of the camera view. I spent a bit too long on that, and messed up the horizontal slider as well, but overall I'm quite happy with how it went. 

I tried to keep structure in my project by splitting as many elements up as I could. If I would have spent 10 more minutes on it I would probably have focused on spacing, padding etc as well as making buttons more dynamic (yellow when on etc).
